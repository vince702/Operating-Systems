produces identical output to the provided simple test img

contents:
	lab3a.cpp the c++ source file for this lab
	Makefile described below
	README
	ext2_fs.h  the provided header file that includes the struct definitions and constants for file exploration

make:
	default: compiles c++ file using g++
	dist: builds the tarball
	clean: removes the executable and tarball generated by make/make dist

Limitations:
as far as I know, this only works on analyzing ext2 file systems, and code is not exactly robust as I used some "magic numbers"
from the ext2 file system documentaion http://www.nongnu.org/ext2-doc/ext2.html#I-BLOCK such as each array of indirect blocks
being 256, and the offset of the blocks starting at 12 for the first primary indirect block.

Also, I don't know if it works with multiple groups for sure, as no test img was provided for multiple groups.
The functions are abstracted to work with any group though.
