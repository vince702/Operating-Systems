Contents: 
	lab4c_tcp.c, the source code for the application for the TCP connection
	lab4c_tls.c, code for TLS connection
	Makefile, 
		dist builds the tarball
		clean removes tarball and generated executable
		logs the shutdown
		default generates lab4b, the executable
	
notes:
	I had to build the mraa library myself, and such for development I used 
	
        sensor = mraa_aio_init(0); 

	for initializing the temperature sensors, but in the tutorial it uses 1 instead of 0, thus in the included file
	I used 1 instead of 0.

	I also changed some exit codes from lab4b, as the spec before didn't mention any. Exit code guide
